pg_rewind
=========

pg_rewind is a tool for synchronizing a PostgreSQL data directory with another
PostgreSQL data directory that was forked from the first one. The result is
equivalent to rsyncing the first data directory (referred to as the old cluster
from now on) with the second one (the new cluster). The advantage of pg_rewind
over rsync is that pg_rewind uses the WAL to determine changed data blocks,
and does not require reading through all files in the cluster. That makes it
a lot faster when the database is large and only a small portion of it differs
between the clusters.

Download
--------

The latest version of this software can be found on the project website at
https://github.com/vmware/pg_rewind.

Installation
------------

Compiling pg_rewind requires the PostgreSQL source tree to be available.
There are two ways to do that:

1. Put pg_rewind project directory inside PostgreSQL source tree as
contrib/pg_rewind, and use "make" to compile

or

2. Pass the path to the PostgreSQL source tree to make, in the top_srcdir
variable: "make USE_PGXS=1 top_srcdir=<path to PostgreSQL source tree>"

In addition, you must have pg_config in $PATH.

The current version of pg_rewind is compatible with PostgreSQL version 9.4.

Usage
-----

    pg_rewind --target-pgdata=<path> \
        --source-server=<new server's conn string>

The contents of the old data directory will be overwritten with the new data
so that after pg_rewind finishes, the old data directory is equal to the new
one.

pg_rewind expects to find all the necessary WAL files in the pg_xlog
directories of the clusters. This includes all the WAL on both clusters
starting from the last common checkpoint preceding the fork. Fetching missing
files from a WAL archive is currently not supported. However, you can copy any
missing files manually from the WAL archive to the pg_xlog directory.

Regression tests
----------------

The test suite of pg_rewind can be launched simply, similarly to what vanilla
PostgreSQL extensions do.

1) Copy code inside PostgreSQL code tree as contrib/pg_rewind:
    make check

2) Manage it as an independent module:
    make installcheck USE_PGXS=1

Theory of operation
-------------------

The basic idea is to copy everything from the new cluster to the old cluster,
except for the blocks that we know to be the same.

1. Scan the WAL log of the old cluster, starting from the last checkpoint before
the point where the new cluster's timeline history forked off from the old cluster.
For each WAL record, make a note of the data blocks that were touched. This yields
a list of all the data blocks that were changed in the old cluster, after the new
cluster forked off.

2. Copy all those changed blocks from the new cluster to the old cluster.

3. Copy all other files like clog, conf files etc. from the new cluster to old cluster.
Everything except the relation files.

4. Apply the WAL from the new cluster, starting from the checkpoint created at
failover. (pg_rewind doesn't actually apply the WAL, it just creates a backup
label file indicating that when PostgreSQL is started, it will start replay
from that checkpoint and apply all the required WAL)

Restrictions
------------

pg_rewind needs that cluster uses either data checksums that can be enabled
at server initialization with initdb or WAL logging of hint bits that can
be enabled by settings "wal_log_hints = on" in postgresql.conf.
